This is a kernel config for HP elite 8200, elitedesk 800 g1 and g2 that I used on one of my kisslinux installs

  - Intel i5 processor
  - Intel graphics
  - Intel 7265 wireless
  - No Initramfs
  - No NVME
  
  - All required modules that I needed are built in

(Used the generated kernel (5.4.6) on an elite 8200 Archcraft install resulting in a systemd-analyze time of 2.3s)

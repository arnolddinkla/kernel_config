This is a kernel config for HP elite 8200, elitedesk 800 g1 and g2 that I used on one of my kisslinux installs

  Intel i5 processor
  
  Intel graphics
  
  Intel 7265 wireless
  
  No Initramfs
  
  No NVME
  
  All required modules that I needed are built in

(Used on an Archcraft install resulting in a systemd-analyze time of 2.3s)
